Technical Requirements
A. Backend:
Framework: .NET Core or .NET 6+.
API: Build RESTful APIs to handle backend logic (e.g., user authentication, task management).
Database: Use Entity Framework Core for database interactions, with SQLite or SQL Server as the database.
Authentication: Implement authentication and authorization using Identity or JWT.
Validation: Validate user inputs on the backend.
B. Frontend:
Framework: Use Razor Pages or MVC.
UI: Create a simple and user-friendly interface with Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.
Task List: Use dynamic elements (like AJAX or partial views) to update the task list without refreshing the page.
C. Deployment:
Host the project on Azure (or another hosting platform like AWS or Heroku).
Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments.

Dark Mode: Implement a toggle for light/dark themes.
